# Project-Portfolio

#### This repository showcases 10 projects I have completed in the past in both programming and machine learning.
#### Each project has the following naming scheme: PROJECT_PURPOSE
###### PROJECT specifies what the project was for (application, model, presentation, etc). 
###### PURPOSE provides a short snippet of what was accomplished.

Application_ParsingEmails: This application parses emails in HTML format to convert them to readable text then sorted each by email part (from, to, title, etc).

Application_ReturningWeather: This application returns current weather data for any location specified by the user.

Application_SortingBiologicalData: This application sorts data in chromatography files specified by the user and outputs the data as graphs of protein concentration over time.

ExecutiveSummary_PRCampaign: This summary presents a proposal to executives of an airline to adopt a PR campaign that would alleviate negative press caused by a crash.

Model_ClassifyingDigits: This classifier identifies the names of written numbers as a type of machine-learning-driven OCR (optical character recognition).

Model_PredictingDeliveryStatus (Parts 1-4):  This model identifies which deliveries from an online retailer will be late so the retailer can remedy the problem accordingly.
 
Model_PredictingEmissions: This model predicts the amount of CO2 emissions from new motor vehicles to ensure government compliance.

Model_PredictingMovieRatings: This model predicts the IMDb rating for new films allowing directors to focus on films predicted to be good ones.
 
Projects 9 and 10 will be completed by June 2022.
