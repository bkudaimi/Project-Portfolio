# About

My name is Bilal Kudaimi and I am a data scientist who is passionate about helping humanity through coding projects. Whether it be machine learning algorithms, desktop applications, or just exploratory data analysis, I want to leave a positive impact on the world! 

# Projects

#### The following are 10 projects I have completed in the past in both programming and machine learning.

#### Each project has the following naming scheme: PROJECT_PURPOSE
###### PROJECT specifies what the project was for (application, model, presentation, etc). 
###### PURPOSE provides a short snippet of what was accomplished.

Application_ParsingEmails: This application parses emails in HTML format to convert them to readable text then sorted each by email part (from, to, title, etc).

Application_ReturningWeather: This application returns current weather data for any location specified by the user.

Application_SortingBiologicalData: This application sorts data in chromatography files specified by the user and outputs the data as graphs of protein concentration over time.

ExecutiveSummary_PRCampaign: This summary presents a proposal to executives of an airline to adopt a PR campaign that would alleviate negative press caused by a crash.

Model_ClassifyingDigits: This classifier identifies the names of written numbers as a type of machine-learning-driven OCR (optical character recognition).

Model_PredictingDeliveryStatus (Parts 1-4):  This model identifies which deliveries from an online retailer will be late so the retailer can remedy the problem accordingly.
 
Model_PredictingEmissions: This model predicts the amount of CO2 emissions from new motor vehicles to ensure government compliance.

Model_PredictingHeartDiseaseRisk: This model predicts which patients will develop heart disease within a certain time frame to save lives and reduce diagnosis costs.

Model_PredictingMovieRatings: This model predicts the IMDb rating for new films allowing directors to focus on films predicted to be good ones.

Kudaimi_Bilal_DS_Project_List: A list of the projects and a short description summarizing each one.

Project 10 is in progress and will be completed by June 2022. Stay tuned for more info!
